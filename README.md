# FF7R-faithful-subs

This repository hosts files supporting the FINAL FANTASY VII Remake "Faithful Subs" localization project.

After reading the suggestions and feedback of supporters and others, I am providing the original Japanese and English files that are used to populate the in-game subtitles to encourage and facilitate community involvement and assistance.

Workflow has been opening the JP and US text file for the same "scene" side-by-side, processing the Japanese text through the translator(s), and comparing to the original English localization.
